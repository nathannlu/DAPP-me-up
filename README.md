# Dap me up
An unspoken greeting performed or done by fist bumping, tapping, or hitting. Usually only by tapping light. Sometimes a person is agressive n hits the other fist hard. It's usually only spoken if the other person is unaware or if a person confronts the other about not doing it or being left hanging with a fist in the air.
> Yo I was looking out for you bro...
